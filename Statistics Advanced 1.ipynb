        "A *random variable* is a function that assigns a numerical value to each outcome in a probabilistic experiment. Formally, given a sample space \\(\\Omega\\) (the set of all possible outcomes), a random variable \\(X\\) is a measurable function \\(X: \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\). Random variables let us move from abstract outcomes (like 'roll is six' or 'it's raining') to numbers that we can analyze with mathematical tools.\n",
        "\n",
        "Random variables are used to model uncertainty: for example, the number of heads in 10 coin flips, the daily sales of a store, or the lifetime (in years) of a lightbulb. Importantly, random variables are characterized by their probability distributions (mass functions for discrete variables or density functions for continuous variables), which tell us how probabilities are assigned to ranges of values.\n",

        "Random variables are commonly categorized into two broad types based on the nature of their possible values:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Discrete random variables:** These take on countable values (finite or countably infinite). Typical examples include counts (number of defects in a batch), outcomes of dice, or categories encoded as integers. Discrete random variables are described by a probability mass function (PMF) \\(p_X(k) = P(X=k)\\) that gives the probability for each possible value.\n",

Continuous random variables are described by a probability density function (PDF) \\(f_X(x)\\) such that probabilities are computed by integrals: \\(P(a \\le X \\le b) = \\int_a^b f_X(x) \\, dx\\). For continuous variables, the probability at any single point is zero; only intervals have positive probability.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are also mixed-type random variables (with both discrete and continuous components), and sometimes subcategories like ordinal variables (discrete with ordering) used in statistics. The choice between discrete and continuous affects the analysis techniques and the tools used (sums vs integrals, PMF vs PDF, etc.)."

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) tells us that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normal if the sample size is reasonably large or if the underlying distribution is not extremely non-normal. In practice, for small samples (like n=20), we typically rely on the t-distribution to account for extra uncertainty when the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",

For small samples and unknown population sd, use the t-distribution critical value \\(t_{\\alpha/2,\\,n-1}\\); for large samples, the normal critical value (\\(z_{\\alpha/2}\\)) can be used.
